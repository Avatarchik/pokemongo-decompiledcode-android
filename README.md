# PokemonGo-SourceCode-Android

Welcome, this is a repo dedicated to finding the source code of Pokemon Go for Android.  As I write this I have been
attempting to decrypt the apk.  I will include the current code I have and will try to decrypt it soon.  Help is 
appreciated!

**UPDATE**
You probably got here from the reddit page.  I need help with this repo.  I don't know whether decrypting the classes was something done before or not.  I would love your input because as most of you are also trying to do, I am trying to find a way to make a working API.
